# SVG Logo Maker

  ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

  ## Description

  In this challenge I was tasked with building a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and saves it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

  ## Demo
